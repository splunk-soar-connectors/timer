<h2>Event Namimg</h2>
<p>
The <b>event_name</b> configuration option will be used as the name of each newly created event.
Optionally, there are two possible values which you can put into this in order to have dynamic names.
<ul>
    <li>$label</li>
    <li>$now</li>
</ul>
These will be appropriately substituted. For example, if you set <b>event_name</b> to "$label event, created on $now",
then a created event could have the name "Email event, created on 2018-01-24T20:02:56.139008+00:00". This timestamp will
always be in UTC.
</p>
